#### `abortMultipartUpload`

``` purescript
abortMultipartUpload :: forall eff. Service -> AbortMultipartUploadRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) AbortMultipartUploadOutput
```

<p>Aborts a multipart upload.</p><p>To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the List Parts operation and ensure the parts list is empty.</p>

#### `completeMultipartUpload`

``` purescript
completeMultipartUpload :: forall eff. Service -> CompleteMultipartUploadRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CompleteMultipartUploadOutput
```

Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

#### `copyObject`

``` purescript
copyObject :: forall eff. Service -> CopyObjectRequest -> Aff (exception :: EXCEPTION | eff) CopyObjectOutput
